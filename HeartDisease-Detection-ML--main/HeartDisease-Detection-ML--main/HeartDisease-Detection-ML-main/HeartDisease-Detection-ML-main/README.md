## Introduction 🚀
This project is a web application that uses a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease. The model is trained on a dataset containing features like age, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate. The application is built using Flask for the backend, HTML/CSS for the frontend, and a pre-trained logistic regression model for predictions.

## Features ✨
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive form for inputting data.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Instantly predicts the likelihood of heart disease.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs.

---

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery)
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)
- **Model Serialization**: Joblib
- **Deployment**: (Add deployment platform if applicable, e.g., Heroku, AWS, etc.)
